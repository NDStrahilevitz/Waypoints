# Waypoints - A Trajectory Generation Library

Waypoints is a Trajectory Generation Library, made for use in robotics application.
It was made during my time participating in the FRC and as such was made for use on the roboRIO in mind, however
it can be used in any project where this is suitable.

The library is currently only supplied for use with C/C++ however Java and Python bindings are planned for the future.

## Getting Started
